!== 7 Dice Roll Game (JavaScript only -- no HTML)


/* 
  !== 7 Dice Roll Game

  RULES: 
  At least 2 players required (otherwise, you can always compete with yourself!).
  
  Open console viewer (Command + Option + J on macOS) on your browser (on any current open webpage or blank page).
  
  Paste game link onto address bar of that same browser window with the open console and 
  'visit' the link.
  
  Once page opens, the "die roll" simulation begins. 
  
  An alert window pops up six times simulating six separate die rolls (click 'OK' or hit 
  'return/Enter' on keyboard to advance to next window/roll die) and the given randomized
  number from 1-6 (die roll result).
  
  For each completed two-pair dice roll, the console displays the result of each die roll 
  from the completed set on one line, in which the two results are separated by a comma.
  
  If a pair's (set of numbers on each line) sum equals 7 (result1 + result2 = 7), that 
  line/set automatically receives a score point of 0.
  
  For each pair that does not equate to the sum of 7, that line is eligible for points in
  which are based on the sum of that pair.
  
  Add up all the points earned.
  
  The player with the most points wins the '!==7 Dice Roll' game!
